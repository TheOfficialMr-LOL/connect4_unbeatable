Hello! This web app was initially designed to only serve as an interface for the near-unbeatable connect 4 algorithm, but it now supports local and remote games too. Players may create game sessions in which they can invite their friends to play connect 4 using a link.

Future update: The core algorithm will be published soon, but, for now, the 'Learn the Algorithm' page is currently a work in progress.

Core AI algorithm is composed of bitboards, dynamic scoring, and the minimax algorithm.
